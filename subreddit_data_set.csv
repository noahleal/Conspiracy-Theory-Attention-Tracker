Megathread: House Passes $3 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill,3426,gkmw8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gkmw8v/megathread_house_passes_3_trillion_coronavirus/,1810,1589624928.0,"The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a $3 trillion Democratic bill aimed at salving the heavy human and economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 Americans and shut much of the economy.

The bill, crafted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, passed mostly along party lines in a 208-199 vote.

But Republicans, who control the Senate, have promised it will be ""dead on arrival"" in their chamber.

Regarding the recent posts related to moderators of large subreddits,58,gki454,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gki454/regarding_the_recent_posts_related_to_moderators/,70,1589607569.0,"Hello all,

The reddit admins reached out to subreddits today with a message regarding the posts related to moderators of large subreddits that had been made over the past few days. In the interests of full transparency, the message is below.

>Hi mods,

>We're writing about the posts in this and several other subreddits that are causing large-scale harassment of the people mentioned within. While we typically do not intervene when users are simply being critical of moderators, these posts are resulting in an unacceptable amount of abuse and harassment of those mentioned and more. We are removing these posts and we expect you as mods to disallow any posts similar to them moving forward.

>If you have already been removing the posts, we have noticed and appreciate it. We wanted to send your team the same message we are sending to subreddits that aren’t removing on their own so all of us can be on the same page.

>We've left a public comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/gk0w4c/to_have_independently_moderated_subreddits/fqqwwzq/?context=3) where you can direct users who inquire about the removals as to deflect them towards us instead of at our volunteer moderators.

>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our moderator mail in /r/ModSupport.

>The Reddit Admins


-------------------------------------------------------------------

While this subreddit had fallen under the category of subreddits that were removing the posts in question, as the mod team here did indeed feel some of the behavior displayed in those threads rose to the level of TOS violations, its clear the admins wanted all subreddits to reinforce to their userbase that threads of that nature going forward will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

Thus, to protect the existence of the subreddit, we will continue to enforce the site wide TOS in the manner we have been doing to this point (although, as the admins note, this does not per se apply to future situations that may involve only criticism of moderators without any accompanying harassment).

If there are any questions, as the admins note, folks can feel free to reach out to the admins via [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/gk0w4c/to_have_independently_moderated_subreddits/fqqwwzq/?context=3).",1,1182,2020-05-16 01:39:29
"[meta] It's not required, but if you make a new account _just_ to post to Relationship Advice, please start the account with `ThrowRA` in the name of your account. [yes this relaxes the rule a bit. An update on the Updates Rule is in here as well]",2347,d3okss,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d3okss/meta_its_not_required_but_if_you_make_a_new/,0,1568406777.0,"**TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

Submission Guidelines - Read before posting.,132,ft4ijw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ft4ijw/submission_guidelines_read_before_posting/,0,1585791715.0,"In an effort to eliminate some of the confusion here is a detailed breakdown of the rules. If your submission was removed it violated one of the following.

&#x200B;

Rule 1: All Submissions must be a confession

&#x200B;

All submissions need to meet the requirements we set for being a confession. Anything “wholesome” does not belong here, period. Cutesy stories about the quirky things you do with your husband/pet/child do not belong here.

**All post are required to be about an immoral or illegal act you, the poster, have committed, with malicious intent**. Your confession can not be what your sister/roommate/step-father did. It can not be a rant about the terrible things other people have done to you. It can not be an accident or innocent mistake on your part. This sub is specifically for people who have done horrible things and want to come clean and talk about their misdeeds. It is not a place to brag about things you've gotten away with, farm karma with amusing stories, or just generally vent about your life.

To reiterate; bragging in any manner will get your post removed. If the sum of your confession is that you stole/cheated/lied, it worked out wonderfully for you and you're happy you did it, then your post is getting deleted. We do not encourage bad behavior.

To be clear, all misdeeds have to be actual actions. **As a policy we do not judge thoughts to be immoral. This means emotions, thoughts, dreams, fantasies, and opinions are not confessions unless you have acted on them**. You can not confess to things that haven't happened yet, or other hypothetical situations.

* Feelings are not immoral acts and therefore not confessions.

ex. *“\_\_\_ died and I feel nothing”, “I hate my \_\_\_”, “ I'm jealous of \_\_\_”, “Here are my thoughts on \_\_\_\_""*

&#x200B;

* This is not the place to post embarrassing stories or little-known facts about yourself.

ex. *“I'm 26 and didn't know \_\_\_” , “I'm \_\_\_ and a virgin” , “ I haven't seen the movie \_\_\_”*

&#x200B;

To reiterate; this is not r/todayilearned, r/tifu, r/Showerthoughts, r/humblebrag, r/unpopularopinion, r/pettyrevenge, r/sex, r/relationships, r/depression, r/casualconversation, or r/offmychest. All those subs already exist for a reason, so please go there to post those types of stories. They do not belong here and will be removed.

&#x200B;

Rule 2: All confessions must be specifically titled

This one should be simple – **no clickbait allowed**. All titles must specifically say what you've done. It can't be a random conversation quote, open-ended question, or a single word. If you can't title your post appropriately, then chances are you didn't do anything to confess to, or you're being obstinately vague in the hopes of getting more attention.

Your post shouldn't read with any uncertainty. If you did something, say what it is. The general idea is that your title is a TLDR synopsis. Vague titles will be removed, no exceptions.

ex. *“I must confess...”, “I ruined \_\_\_\_'s life” , “kleptomaniac”, ""I can't forgive myself""*

&#x200B;

Rule 3: We do not encourage bad behavior

We do not allow post that glorify, attempt to normalize, or feature gratuitous instances of rape, animal abuse, racism, or violence. As a general rule do not post if these are the subject matter and their removal will be done at our discretion.

&#x200B;

Rule 4: No relationship-related post

This one is very simple; we do not allow any post regarding relationships and will remove them. Notice it does not say ""romantic relationship"". It does not matter if you're ""just friends"" or they are your FWB. **If your post is centered around a relationship, romantic, sexual, financial, or otherwise, it will be removed.** This is not the place to vent about drama with your social circle or your love life.

ex. *“I still love my ex”, “I ghosted \_\_\_”, “I have a fantasy about \_\_\_”, ""I no longer care about \_\_\_\_"", “I have a \_\_\_ fetish”*

&#x200B;

Rule 5: No pedophilia

We do not accept any post regarding sexual situations minors. This includes stories of abuse that had happened in the past. There are no shades of grey with this rule; if there is talk of sexual abuse and children it will be removed.

&#x200B;

Rule 6: Limited content

In addition tot he title, the body of your post needs to give content to your submission. We do not accept vague or cryptic post that do not explain your confession.

&#x200B;

Rule 7: No politics

Politics do not belong here. This aligns with rule 1, as this is not the place to post your opinions and start arguments. There are plenty of subs already for that purpose. Take it there.

&#x200B;

Rule 9: No Trolling

Do not post spam, memes, shitpost, jokes, etc. We ask that you try to meaningfully contribute to the conversation. 

&#x200B;

Rule 11: No self-advertisement or crowdfunding

Due to constant scams and abuse we do not allow any form of crowdfunding. Routinely we get post about someone's unfortunate situation followed by a paypal link. If you are fishing for donations or just posting spam in the form of advertising your youtube channel, twitch, onlyfans, etc, you will be banned.",2,0,2020-04-01 21:41:55
